## Welcome to Annai!

![annai demo](annai-demo.gif)

Annai is tourism for the gig economy. Users and Tour Guides match based on preferences, services provided, and location in Japan. Tour Guides are free to set their own rates and transactions are handled safely and securely over Stripe. Stack: PEVN (PostgreSQL, Vue), originally deployed on Heroku.

Annai is one of my first full-stack experiences with an outside API. In this case, Stripe. The UI needs a lot of work but for now I've moved on to other projects. Feel free to view a demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ-MvmWh1Zs).

### We created Annai using:

- PostgresQL (migrations with Knex)
- Vue.js
- Express / Node
- JWT
- Stripe

To run:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

And enjoy your trip!
